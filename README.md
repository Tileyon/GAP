# Graphics Agnostic Python (GAP)

**GAP** is a visual interface designer written in `Python` that produces complete python scripts with modern graphical interfaces. These scripts may be executed verbatim under all five major computing platforms (MS Windows, OS X, Linux, iOS an Android) with consistent look feel and functionality. **GAP** is a universal Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment for the `Python` language. A prospective user needs only grasp rudimentary concepts of modern user interface elements without any idea of the coding involved. The module and its output require kivy or the Pythonista UI in order to function.

**GAP** was designed with the utmost emphasis on simplicity. A three line instruction (displayed in the application's window) should be sufficient for a new user to start interacting with the environment then design and generate a full fledge application in minutes if not seconds.

**GAP** is composed of a virtual screen that occupies most of the surface of its window starting at the top left, a few buttons and text fields at the right of that virtual screen and three lines of instruction at the very bottom. The virtual screen is an exact replica of the one generated by its output with all its components properly scaled and positioned. The top five buttons create corresponding components at predefined positions and sizes. These components can be selected and dragged anywhere on the virtual screen. Their positions and sizes can be altered by changing the four text fields to a desired value then clicking or touching the `Modify` button. A selected component can be removed with the `Delete` button. The `Save` button will create a fully functional `Python` script named `gapout.py` that reflects perfectly the virtual screen and its elements. **GAP** will automatically define functions that are bound to every button in the interface. Users may modify these functions at will to adapt the script's functionality to their specific needs.

**GAP** is built using the `UniPAGe.py` module. The application reads itself to isolate that module and use it to build its output. Therefore, they may be scaled according to a 4/3 ratio without distortion.
