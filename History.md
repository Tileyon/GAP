```GAP``` is the first Python utility based on ```UniPAGe```. Therefore it can be launched on any Python release that includes ```Kivy``` or the ```Pythonista UI```. The use of ```UniPAGe``` guaranties that the script will maintain the same functionality as well as look and feel across all the major computing platforms without modification. It was first published on July 22 2017. It allows the user to visually create a graphic interface from which it generates a complete UniPAGe script ready to run on all targeted platforms. All updates to ```GAP``` will be published under the name gap followed by a number corresponding to the chronological order of their creation but not a version number per se. This file will describe the evolution of ```GAP``` through the modifications of its core classes and independent functions in lieu of a formal ChangeLog. For more information, refer to the [**UniPAGe**](https://github.com/Tileyon/UniPAGe) repository.
